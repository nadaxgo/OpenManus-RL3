# OpenManus Environment

This environment exposes a simple server that executes python code using the
`PythonExecute` tool from the `OpenManus-main` project. It serves as a minimal
example showing how OpenManus functionalities can be integrated with the
AgentGym framework.

Start the server with:

```bash
python -m agentenv_openmanus.launch --port 8000
```

# OpenManus Environment

This environment exposes a simple server that executes Python code using a
lightweight `PythonExecute` tool vendored in this directory. It demonstrates how
OpenManus functionalities can be integrated without depending on the original
OpenManus codebase.

Start the server with:

```bash
python -m agentenv_openmanus.launch --port 8000
```
